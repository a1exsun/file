1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:05,240
well thank you very much it's an honor

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,799
to have President zalinski of Ukraine

3
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:09,399
and we've been working very hard very

4
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:11,558
close and we've actually known each

5
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:13,480
other for a long time we've been dealing

6
00:00:11,558 --> 00:00:17,078
with each other for a long time and very

7
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:18,720
well uh we had little negotiation spat

8
00:00:17,079 --> 00:00:21,079
but that worked out great I think for

9
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:24,238
for both countries I think for the world

10
00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:28,239
actually Beyond both countries and we

11
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:30,559
have something that is a very fair deal

12
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:33,158
and we look forward to getting in and

13
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:35,639
digging digging digging and working and

14
00:00:33,159 --> 00:00:37,558
getting some of the rare earth but it

15
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,760
means we're going to be inside and it's

16
00:00:37,558 --> 00:00:42,319
uh it's a big commitment from the United

17
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:45,199
States and we appreciate working with

18
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:48,039
you very much and uh we will continue to

19
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,799
do that we have had some very good

20
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:52,600
discussions with Russia I spoke with

21
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:54,598
President Putin and we're going to try

22
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,199
and bring this to a close it's something

23
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,119
that you want and that he wants we have

24
00:00:56,198 --> 00:01:01,638
to negotiate a deal but we've started

25
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:04,798
the confines of a deal and I think

26
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:08,798
something can happen uh the big thing is

27
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:10,478
the uh number of soldiers mostly at this

28
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,520
point but soldiers being killed you're

29
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:14,559
losing thousands of soldiers on both

30
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:17,238
sides we're losing a lot of soldiers and

31
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,399
we want to see it stop and we want to

32
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:22,437
see the money get put to different kinds

33
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:24,919
of use like rebuilding the rebuilding

34
00:01:22,438 --> 00:01:26,398
and we're going to be working very hard

35
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:28,839
but we've had a lot of very good

36
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,119
conversations I will say until we came

37
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:33,118
along the Biden Administration didn't

38
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:35,158
speak to Russia whatsoever they didn't

39
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:35,919
speak to anybody they just allowed this

40
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:39,240
to

41
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:41,360
continue and uh I will say that uh I'll

42
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:43,599
say in front of you you've heard me say

43
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:45,238
it a thousand times if I were president

44
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:47,038
of this war would have never happened we

45
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:49,397
would have had a deal negotiated for you

46
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,559
without having to go through what you've

47
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:54,679
gone through but you uh your soldiers

48
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,319
have been unbelievably Brave we've given

49
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,880
them great equipment but they somebody

50
00:01:56,319 --> 00:02:01,158
has to use the equipment they've been

51
00:01:57,879 --> 00:02:03,638
unbelievably Brave and we give him great

52
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:06,880

70

somewhat of an exciting moment but the

71
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:54,279
really exciting moment is where we get a

72
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:55,878
when they stop the shooting or we end up

73
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:58,640
with a deal and I think we're fairly

74
00:02:55,878 --> 00:03:00,919
close to getting that and uh an honor to

75
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:02,999

00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:14,519
first document will be first step to

80
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:17,879
real security guarantees for Ukraine our

81
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:20,480
people our children I really count on it

82
00:03:17,878 --> 00:03:22,878
and of course we count that America will

83
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:26,398
not stop support really for us is very

84
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:28,318
important to support and to continue it

85
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,480
I want to discuss it with details

86
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:32,999
further during our ation and of course

87
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:35,559
the infrastructure or security

88
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,799
guarantees because for today I

89
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,640
understand what Europe is ready to do

90
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:42,480
and of course I want to discuss with you

91
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:44,839
what United States will be ready to do

92
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:47,797
and uh I really count on your strong

93
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:50,040
position to stop Putin and uh and you

94
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:52,760
said that enough with the War I think

95
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:55,119
that is very important Ben to say these

96
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:56,797
wars to Putin at the very beginning at

97
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,280
the very beginning of War because he is

98
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:01,799
a killer and terrorist but I hope that

99
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,999
together we can stop him but for us it's

100
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:08,518
very important to you know to save our

101
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,519
country our values our freedom the

102
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:13,759
democracy and of course uh no

103
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:16,358
compromises with the killer about our

104
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:18,678
territories but it will be later and of

105
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:21,039
course I what I wanted you know we spoke

106
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:23,120
about it by phone with you about the

107
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,919
Dron production we have very good Dron

108
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:28,160
production I think the best one in the

109
00:04:24,918 --> 00:04:30,879
world for today because of the war yes

110
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,400
and uh of course we need need very much

111
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:35,159
uh the air defense you have the best air

112
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:37,998
defense in the world and really you

113
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:40,560
helped us under attacks of Russians and

114
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,038
I want to speak how we can exchange the

115
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,359
licenses we're open to share the

116
00:04:43,038 --> 00:04:46,799
licenses of all our drones with you of

117
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,239
course with the United States and we

118
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,559
need licenses for quick production of

119
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:55,198
air defense even after the war we need

120
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:57,919
our nation to be come that we're secured

121
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:01,120
so that's why we need this air shield

122
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:03,839
and of course about this uh I want to

123
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:06,879
speak about the contingence I think that

124
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:08,917
France and UK already spoke to you and

125
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:11,558
we know that Europe is ready but without

126
00:05:08,918 --> 00:05:15,398
the United States they will not be ready

127
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:18,600
to be as strong as we need and uh the

128
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:21,317
last point last not least uh about

129
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:23,199
exchange about our people and children

130
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:26,240
and you know that this crazy Russian

131
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:28,080
that they stolen 20,000 of children

132
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,240

00:07:51,478 --> 00:07:55,998
created today and how does this provide

186
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:57,838
long-term security for Ukraine well we

187
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,120
don't know exactly how much because

188
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:00,079
we're going to be putting some money in

189
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,199
a fun

190
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:04,998
uh that we're going to get from the raar

191
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:06,758
earth that we're going to be taking and

192
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,638
sharing in terms of Revenue so it's

193
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:10,919
going to be a lot of money will be made

194
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,440
from the sale and from the use of raw

195
00:08:10,918 --> 00:08:14,317
Earth and as you know our country

196
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:17,519
doesn't have much raw Earth we have a

197
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:20,719
lot of oil and gas but we don't have a

198
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:23,078
lot of the raw Earth and what we do have

199
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,878
is protected by the environmentalists

200
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:28,998
but that could be unprotected but still

201
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:31,879
it's not very much uh they have F among

202
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,839
the best in the world in terms of R so

203
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:36,640
we're going to be using that taking it

204
00:08:34,839 --> 00:08:39,680
using it for all of the things we do

205
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:42,398
including Ai and including weapons and

206
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:44,438
the military and it's uh really going to

207
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,1000
very much satisfy our needs so something

208
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:48,560
that just worked out uh really well we

209
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,160
have a lot of oil and we have a lot of

210
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:53,958
gas we have a lot but we don't have raw

211
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:56,038
Earth so uh this uh this has just about

212
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:58,398
every component of the raw Earth that we

213
00:08:56,039 --> 00:09:01,077
need for computers for all of the things

214
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:03,360
we do this puts us in great shape and

215
00:09:01,078 --> 00:09:04,957
longterm security for UK do this

216
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,399
provided I think they're going to have

217
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:08,599
great long I think once we make the

218
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,160
agreement that's going to be 95% of it

219
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:12,800
it's they're not going to go back to

220
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:16,159
fighting uh I've spoken with President

221
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:18,278
Putin and uh I think I mean I feel very

222
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:20,559
strong I've known them for a long time

223
00:09:18,278 --> 00:09:23,398
and I feel very strongly that uh they're

224
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:24,958
very serious about it and we'll make a

225
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:27,160
deal and when the deal is made I don't

226
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:28,518
think we talk about security everyone's

227
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:30,239
talking about the other day all they

228
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:32,240
talked about was security I said let me

229
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,958
make the deal first I have to make the

230
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,679
deal first I don't worry about security

231
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:38,517
right now I got have to we have to have

232
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:41,919
a deal cuz right now last week 2,000

233
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:45,360
soldiers died on both sides 2,000 and

234
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:47,398
they're losing a th000 2,000 3,000 a

235
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,039
week so as we sit here and we talk

236
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:52,120
people are getting shot and dying on the

237
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:54,439
battlefield and you know they're not

238
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:56,639
American soldiers but they're Russian

239
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:59,480
soldiers and they're Ukrainian soldiers

240
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:01,478
and we want to be able to stop it and

241
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:03,319
want to be able also to spend money on

242
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:05,760
other things we don't want to this is a

243
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:08,199
tremendous amount of money and what the

244
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:09,598
Biden Administration did was terrible

245
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,958
they were giving money but he had no

246
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,560
security on the money Europe as you know

247
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:15,799
gave much less money but they had

248
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:17,358
security it was in the form of a loan

249
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:20,478
they get their money back and we didn't

250
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:22,119
and now at least we're protected because

251
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:25,640
the American taxpayer has to be

252
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:29,839
protected too but uh this is an

253
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:31,438
incredible agreement for Ukraine because

254
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:34,720
we have a big investment in their

255
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:37,839
country now and and what what they have

256
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,1000
very few people have and we're able to

257
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,880
uh really go forward with very very

258
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,120
high-tech things and many other things

259
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:46,798
including Weaponry Weaponry that we're

260
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:49,759
going to use in many locations but that

261
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:52,957
we need for our country this allows this

262
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:55,077
allows us to do this will you continue

263
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:58,879
will you I'm sorry I'm

264
00:10:55,078 --> 00:11:01,759
sorry yes go ahead please if I can just

265
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:04,077
add yes in the document there is one of

266
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:06,999
the very important points uh if we speak

267
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:10,318
about business and investment we never

268
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,160
had LG terminals in Ukraine this

269
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,398
document will open I mean the next

270
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:16,878
documents but anyway the here we see in

271
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:19,160
the framework we we see we see a really

272
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:21,077
good will for this LG terminals for us

273
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:24,319
is very important and I think for

274
00:11:21,078 --> 00:11:27,318
security of European continent we have

275
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:30,039
the biggest storage gas storage we have

276
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:33,159
the biggest in Europe yes it's

277
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:35,957
yeah and we can use it you get for LNG

278
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:38,077
use it for L and we will do it and

279
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:39,918
really we we can help Europe because

280
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:43,637
Europe really helped president Trump

281
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:46,638
said that they made uh less support but

282
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:50,278
they have our friends and they our very

283
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:53,959
supportive uh Partners they really gave

284
00:11:50,278 --> 00:11:56,638
a lot Mr BR they really they did they

285
00:11:53,958 --> 00:12:03,798
gave a lot but they gave much less no

286
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:03,799
much less no no don't argue with no okay

287
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:13,160
okay yeah please uh Mr President Trump

288
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:17,039
you have repeatedly called the deal with

289
00:12:13,159 --> 00:12:19,518
Ukraine has as a historical one and as a

290
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:21,878
president of the United States you make

291
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:25,600
historical decision in other issues

292
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:28,278
which affect America and other world so

293
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,920
uh what place in the world history do

294
00:12:28,278 --> 00:12:33,638
you want to take

295
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:37,398
and do you associate your yourself with

296
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:37,398
any famous historical

297
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:43,560
figures yeah I'd say George Washington

298
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,320
Abraham Lincoln I would say I'm far

299
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:47,719
superior to George Washington and

300
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:49,760
Abraham Lincoln now you know I'm only

301
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:51,320
kidding right because when I say that

302
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:52,719
the fake news is going to go wild

303
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,880
they're going to say he considers

304
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:58,079
himself to be better than Washington but

305
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:59,999
you never know you never know uh I don't

306
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:03,637
compare myself to any I just have I'm

307
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,399
here to do a job we've had a great 35

308
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:08,119
days or whatever it might be a month a

309
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:10,559
little more than a month uh We've

310
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:12,120
accomplished tremendous amounts not only

311
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:13,878
this this would be a very great

312
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:16,160
achievement if we could get this the war

313
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:17,957
stopped and get them back to

314
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:20,559
normalization I think that's going to

315
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:23,398
happen we've had very good talks on both

316
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:25,158
sides as you know but uh I think we've

317
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:26,760
done a very good job just generally if

318
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:28,799
you look at all of the things we've done

319
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:31,518
in 30 days they're saying there's never

320
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:33,799
been a a opening for a president the

321
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:36,679
first month uh there's never been a

322
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:38,239
first month like uh like we've had and

323
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:39,879
this is one of the very important things

324
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,679
this to me is one of the most important

325
00:13:39,879 --> 00:13:43,559
things

326
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:46,039
because we have tremendous death taking

327
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:47,599
place as we speak and I don't want to

328
00:13:46,039 --> 00:13:49,438
have that you know think of the parents

329
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,720
think of the whether they're in Russia

330
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,279
or Ukraine think of the parents of all

331
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:56,479
these people being killed needlessly

332
00:13:54,278 --> 00:13:59,678
they came to all should have never

333
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:03,600
started this would if I were president

334
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:08,077
this would have never started

335
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:12,078
Mr Mr will you continue sending military

336
00:14:08,078 --> 00:14:14,078
aid to Ukraine after you uh the US signs

337
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:17,919
this agreement with

338
00:14:14,078 --> 00:14:20,238
Ukraine zensky do you feel like the US

339
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:24,478
is on your side that the president that

340
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:26,680
President Trump is on your side at this

341
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,159
uh at this

342
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:31,637
moment what do you think he wants to

343
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:33,798
know do you think that sort of a stupid

344
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:35,240
question because I guess I guess we

345
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:38,678
wouldn't be here if I

346
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:40,999
wasn't but uh I think that I think that

347
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:42,558
the United States on our side from the

348
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,160
very beginning of

349
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:48,799
occupation and uh I think that President

350
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:51,277
Trump on our side and and of course I

351
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:54,119
not I'm sure that United States

352
00:14:51,278 --> 00:14:57,159
President will not stop support this is

353
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:59,519
crucial for us it's important for us yes

354
00:14:57,159 --> 00:15:01,638
and Putin president speaks about the

355
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,398
people and the soldiers which are dying

356
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:05,879
but they came to our territory they came

357
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:09,799
to our land they began this war and they

358
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:12,039
have to stop and uh I think all this is

359
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:14,799
the question with really the most

360
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:18,798
important question can president Trump I

361
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:21,957
hope yes with some other allies to stop

362
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:24,598
Putin withdraw these enemies our ene

363
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:27,198
withdraw these troops from our land and

364
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:29,720
I think that you asked about the history

365
00:15:27,198 --> 00:15:32,678
about the I think that if president or

366
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:35,319
when he will stop Putin if president

367
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:38,999
Trump will bring peace to our country I

368
00:15:35,318 --> 00:15:42,598
think he will be on this wall time we've

369
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,600
had very very good uh

370
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:48,239
talks what about minitary a to Ukraine

371
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,240
president m m president zinski just said

372
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:54,600
that there' be no compromises with uh um

373
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:56,759
Vladimir Putin um I just wanted to ask

374
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:58,120
both of you firstly um are there

375
00:15:56,759 --> 00:15:59,560
compromises that you think that

376
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:01,278
president zinski is going to have to

377
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:02,799
make and president zilinski is there

378
00:16:01,278 --> 00:16:04,318
anything that you might you think that

379
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:07,039
you may be able to offer or bring to the

380
00:16:04,318 --> 00:16:08,318
table for example elections thank you I

381
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:10,638
think you're going to have to always

382
00:16:08,318 --> 00:16:12,478
make compromises you can't do any deals

383
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,119
without compromises so certainly he's

384
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,999
going to have to make some compromises

385
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:18,240
but hopefully they won't be as big as

386
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,160
some people think you're going to have

387
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,518
to make that's all it's all we can do

388
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:25,239
I'm here as a as an arbitrator as a

389
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:27,719
mediator to a certain extent between two

390
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:29,119
parties that have uh been very hostile

391
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:31,398
to put it mildly they've been very

392
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,799
hostile this has been a vicious War this

393
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:36,040
been a vicious War you know it's a very

394
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:38,358
level Battlefield and uh those bullets

395
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:41,239
go out and as I've said many times we're

396
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:42,959
talking about it with Pete uh many times

397
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:45,680
the only thing stopping those bullets is

398
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:47,559
a human body and in the case we're

399
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:49,719
talking about generally young human

400
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:51,679
bodies are stopping a lot of bullets

401
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:53,639
it's dead level that's what why it's

402
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:55,757
great Farmland it's great land it's

403
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:57,879
great Farmland but there's very little

404
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:59,560
protection against the bullets that are

405
00:16:57,879 --> 00:17:03,718
being and other things that are being

406
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:06,078
shot so all I can do is see if I can get

407
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:07,280
everybody at the table and get an

408
00:17:06,078 --> 00:17:08,598
agreement and I think we're going to end

409
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:11,918
up with an agreement otherwise I

410
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:11,917
wouldn't probably be even here

411
00:17:13,838 --> 00:17:18,798
today I Mr President I got two questions

412
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:21,159
for you think ultimately your legacy

413
00:17:18,798 --> 00:17:23,879
will be The Peacemaker and not the

414
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:26,438
president that led this country into

415
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:28,960
another war and ended Foreign Wars and

416
00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:29,1000
I've got I hope it will I mean I hope

417
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,600
I'm going to

418
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,960
be uh remembered as a

419
00:17:32,599 --> 00:17:36,398
peacemaker uh this is this would be a

420
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,399
great thing if we could do this I'm

421
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,558
doing this to save lives more than

422
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,400
anything else second is to save a lot of

423
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:44,678
money but I considered that to be far

424
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,1000
less important uh so I hope I'm going to

425
00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:48,879
thank you Brian for that question it was

426
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,200
a nice question uh I hope I'll be known

427
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,759
and recognized as a peacemaker this this

428
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,959
would be a great thing to solve this is

429
00:17:52,759 --> 00:17:58,558
a very dangerous situation you know this

430
00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:01,360
could lead to a third world war this is

431
00:17:58,558 --> 00:18:04,279
this was headed in the wrong direction

432
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:06,158
if this election were lost if we didn't

433
00:18:04,279 --> 00:18:08,319
win this election and by way we won it

434
00:18:06,159 --> 00:18:10,1000
by a lot that was a mandate we won every

435
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:13,078
swing state we won the popular vote by

436
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,639
millions and millions of votes we won

437
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:18,558
everything uh the districts you look at

438
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:21,519
the areas of of red take a look at a map

439
00:18:18,558 --> 00:18:23,678
this was a big mandate and uh this was

440
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:26,158
one of the things I said we're going to

441
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:27,879
get this thing settled if we didn't win

442
00:18:26,159 --> 00:18:30,079
I think this would have this could have

443
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:32,399
very well ended up in a third world war

444
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:33,878
and that would not that would not have

445
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,319
been a good situation what was your

446
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:37,759
second question my second question for

447
00:18:35,319 --> 00:18:39,958

than yeah thank

461
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:16,999
[Music]

462
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:19,679
you Mr President are you going to send

463
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,200
more arms to Ukraine in case there's no

464
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:24,280
peace yeah we're going to have arms to

465
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,840
Ukraine yeah sure hopefully I won't have

466
00:19:24,279 --> 00:19:27,598
to send very much because hopefully

467
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:29,758
we're going to have it finished we're

468
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:32,118
looking forward to finish in this

469
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:33,638
quickly uh we're not looking forward to

470
00:19:32,119 --> 00:19:35,199
sending a lot of arms we're looking

471
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:39,279
forward to getting the war finished so

472
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:41,079
we can uh do other things but uh we very

473
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:44,319
much appreciate the agreement because we

474
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:45,878
needed what they had and we're treating

475
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:48,158
you know our country is now treated

476
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:49,199
fairly Biden didn't do that Biden didn't

477
00:19:48,159 --> 00:19:50,480
he didn't know what the hell he was

478
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,559
doing this should have never happened

479
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:55,399
this should have never started but uh

480
00:19:53,558 --> 00:19:57,478
you know sure the answer is yes but

481
00:19:55,400 --> 00:20:00,039
hopefully we won't have to send much

482
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:03,159
because I'm looking forward to get it

483
00:20:00,038 --> 00:20:04,959
done getting it done quickly very

484
00:20:03,159 --> 00:20:07,200
quickly does that provide security

485
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,960
guarantees Mr President uh I don't want

486
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,440
to talk about security yet because I

487
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,359
want to get the deal done you know you

488
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:14,158
fall into the same trap like everybody

489
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:16,278
else a million times you said over and

490
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:19,038
over I want to get the deal done

491
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:21,078
security is so easy that's about 2% of

492
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:22,678
the problem uh I'm not worried about

493
00:20:21,079 --> 00:20:25,079
security I'm worried about getting the

494
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:27,199
deal done uh the security is the easy

495
00:20:25,079 --> 00:20:29,638
part security is very nice everybody

496
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,999
stops shooting and now will Europe put

497
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:34,558
people there I know France is going to I

498
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,919
know the UK is going to I know other

499
00:20:34,558 --> 00:20:38,239
countries are going to and they happen

500
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:39,839
to be right next or we haven't committed

501
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,960
but we could conceivably you know we

502
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:44,678
have Security in a different form we'll

503
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:47,799
have workers there uh digging digging

504
00:20:44,679 --> 00:20:50,039
digging taking the raw Earth so that we

505
00:20:47,798 --> 00:20:52,759
can create a lot of great product in

506
00:20:50,038 --> 00:20:54,639
this country uh so in that sense you

507
00:20:52,759 --> 00:20:57,079
have something but we haven't determined

508
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:59,479
that yet I will say uh in speaking to

509
00:20:57,079 --> 00:21:01,638
France and in speaking to and they were

510
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:05,640
here as you know last week and just the

511
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:07,558
other day uh they have committed to a

512
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:09,159
lot of security I don't think you're

513
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:11,678
going to need much security I think once

514
00:21:09,159 --> 00:21:13,279
this deal gets done it's over Russia is

515
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:15,119
not going to want to go back and

516
00:21:13,278 --> 00:21:16,999
nobody's going to want to go back when

517
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:19,599
this when this deal ends I really

518
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,360
believe this deal is is going to be over

519
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:24,879
uh question yeah please go ahead go

520
00:21:22,359 --> 00:21:27,118
ahead thank you so president thank

521
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,439
youing here starm at the White House

522
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:30,958
this past week both of appraised your

523
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,039
courage and conviction to lead the

524
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,679
pathway towards peace yes part of that

525
00:21:33,038 --> 00:21:37,158
involved though re-engaging Russia in

526
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:38,799
diplomatic relations something that

527
00:21:37,159 --> 00:21:40,918
previous leaders lacked the conviction

528
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:42,639
to do so what gave you the moral courage

529
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:45,359
and conviction to step forward and Lead

530
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:47,558
that well I love this guy who are you

531
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:49,677
with one American News sir well that's

532
00:21:47,558 --> 00:21:51,199
why I like him one American News does a

533
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:53,279
great job that's very I like the

534
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:56,240
question I think it's a very good

535
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:59,678
question it is it's a pathway to peace

536
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:01,278
it's a pathway to getting something s

537
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:03,520
and I feel that as the head of this

538
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:05,718
country I have an obligation to do that

539
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:09,078
plus you know we're very much involved

540
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:10,359
we got involved uh it's too bad we got

541
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:11,558
involved because there should have been

542
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:13,359
no involvement because there should have

543
00:22:11,558 --> 00:22:15,838
been no war and there shouldn't have

544
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:18,118
been October 7th that would have never

545
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:20,079

583
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:57,558
the president never broke in 2016 you

584
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:59,599
been the president Mr Mr President

585
00:23:57,558 --> 00:24:02,119
you've been the president but he for he

586
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:04,599
had of course not with you but he had

587
00:24:02,119 --> 00:24:07,319
during those period he had conversations

588
00:24:04,599 --> 00:24:09,398
with our side and we had Normandy for

589
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:11,838
format you know the France Germany

590
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:13,720
Ukraine and Russia and he broken 25

591
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:17,398
times that's why we will

592
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:19,519
never accept just ceire it will not work

593
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:21,959
without security guarantees security

594
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:24,557
guarantees maybe president is right

595
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:26,719
about this document and other but this

596
00:24:24,558 --> 00:24:29,439
document is not enough strong Army is

597
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:31,439
enough because he soldiers afraid Putin

598
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,799
soldiers afraid of our soldiers when

599
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:36,199
we're strong enough if we are not strong

600
00:24:33,798 --> 00:24:40,038
enough if we are empty if our stor is

601
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:42,398
empty we can't defend our our land today

602
00:24:40,038 --> 00:24:44,719
you know he knows that we have me all

603
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:47,359
the world knows that we have meeting yes

604
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:49,798
why he's using ballistic Putin today

605
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:52,918
using ballistic on our Hospital schools

606
00:24:49,798 --> 00:24:54,998
and Etc ballistic so he knows that we

607
00:24:52,919 --> 00:24:57,798
are here and that President Trump is

608
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,240
really have good will to stop to stop

609
00:24:57,798 --> 00:25:01,758
this war

610
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:03,759
and I and you you hear now the president

611
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:06,358
so why he's using so he doesn't want to

612
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:08,917
stop he doesn't want but I hope that we

613
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:10,918
will do it really we'll do it security

614
00:25:08,919 --> 00:25:13,239
when we speak about security guarantees

615
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:18,279
when the Europeans are ready for

616
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:20,200
contingence they need USA back stop if

617
00:25:18,278 --> 00:25:22,359
there will not be United States we will

618
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:24,360
not never have any contigent strong

619
00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:27,038
cones from the Europeans because they

620
00:25:24,359 --> 00:25:30,078
don't want to divide airines connection

621
00:25:27,038 --> 00:25:33,438
between the United States the main and

622
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:35,439
strongest C and Europeans and this is

623
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:38,039
crucial this is important that what we

624
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:40,440
want to speak about very much this is

625
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:43,839
very important and a

626
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:45,760
defense so air defense really we have

627
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:48,758
big deficit with all these systems and

628
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:52,398
we need to provide this we need it very

629
00:25:48,759 --> 00:25:54,119
much otherwise Putin will never stop and

630
00:25:52,398 --> 00:25:56,878
we'll go further and further he doesn't

631
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:58,798
want he he hate us you know it's not

632
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:01,679

00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:05,440
thinks and he shared This Ss I think

635
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:07,999
maybe with your team also I don't know

636
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:10,119
but with all the Europeans in media

637
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,918
officially and not he always said that

638
00:26:10,119 --> 00:26:16,157
we there is no such country such Nation

639
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:20,239

after Russian invasion of Ukraine uh

your creditor sent additional troops to

680
00:28:06,759 --> 00:28:11,759
Eastern Europe including Poland my

681
00:28:08,798 --> 00:28:14,759
country yeah are you committed to

682
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:15,719
keeping this troops on the Eastern flank

683
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:19,879
of

684
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:22,559
NATO uh in the future I'm very committed

685
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:24,639
to Poland I think Poland is really

686
00:28:22,558 --> 00:28:26,199
stepped up and done a great job for NATO

687
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:29,678
they as you know they paid more than

688
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:32,320
they had to they are one of the finest

689
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:34,240
groups of people I've ever known uh I'm

690
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:35,678
very committed to Poland what about Bal

691
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:38,320
Poland's in a tough neighborhood you

692
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:42,518
know what about Baltic the baltics uh

693
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:44,517
the baltics uh they got a lot of it's a

694
00:28:42,519 --> 00:28:46,039
tough neighborhood too but we're

695
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:48,360
committed we're going to be very

696
00:28:46,038 --> 00:28:49,917
committed and we're committed to Nato

697
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:51,798
but NATO has to step up and the

698
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:53,960
Europeans have to step up more than they

699
00:28:51,798 --> 00:28:55,879
have and I want to see them equalize

700
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:58,240
because they are in for far less than

701
00:28:55,880 --> 00:29:00,960
we're in and they should be at least

702
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,558
equal you understand that why is the

703
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,919
United States we have an ocean in

704
00:29:02,558 --> 00:29:08,078
between why is the United States in for

705
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:10,039
so much more money and other things as

706
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:12,319
Europe with that being said and as you

707
00:29:10,038 --> 00:29:15,158
said they've also been obviously very

708
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:19,397
helpful but we have put in far more than

709
00:29:15,159 --> 00:29:19,399
they have and I think they should

710
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:24,079
equalize yeah please go ahead today what

711
00:29:22,599 --> 00:29:26,999
changed between the first time that

712
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:28,758
secretary Bess gave president zinsky the

713
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:32,879
agreement and today for

714
00:29:28,759 --> 00:29:34,719
we made a deal so Wasing Factor I'm I'm

715
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,600
a business person we made a deal that's

716
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,479
what

717
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:41,318
changed I didn't think we were going to

718
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:43,279
make a deal and uh we ended up making

719
00:29:41,319 --> 00:29:44,839
the deal so that Chang Mr President what

720
00:29:43,278 --> 00:29:47,359
and how do you envision a trilateral

721
00:29:44,839 --> 00:29:48,917
summit with president zinsky and I don't

722
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:51,599
know but it's well they don't like each

723
00:29:48,919 --> 00:29:53,399
other I can tell you that okay they do

724
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:56,079
not like each other this is not a love

725
00:29:53,398 --> 00:29:59,277
match and it's unfortunate that's why

726
00:29:56,079 --> 00:30:01,678
you're in this situation Mr the United

727
00:29:59,278 --> 00:30:04,157
States should not have allowed this to

728
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:07,799
happen Okay the United

729
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:11,720
States run by a man that didn't know

730
00:30:07,798 --> 00:30:14,158
much I'm going to be very nice run by an

731
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:16,399
incompetent person very incompetent

732
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:18,678
person should never have allowed this to

733
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:20,917
happen I've stopped Wars I've stopped

734
00:30:18,679 --> 00:30:22,279
many wars my people will tell you I

735
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:24,399
stopped Wars that nobody ever heard

736
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:28,199
about I sto Wars before they ever

737
00:30:24,398 --> 00:30:29,638
started you can look at some of uh some

738
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,840
I could give you a lot of Nations that

739
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,999
would tell you right now they were

740
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:34,638
probably going to war I could tell you

741
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,120
right now there's a nation thinking

742
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,798
about going to war on something that

743
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:41,718
nobody in this room has ever even heard

744
00:30:38,798 --> 00:30:45,759
about two smaller Nations but big still

745
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:47,439
big and i' I think I've stopped it but

746
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:51,478
this should have never happened Mr

747
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:54,319
President about uh sorry just a second

748
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:56,638
uh about the any negotiations that first

749
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:59,038
of all I want I want really to tell you

750
00:30:56,638 --> 00:31:01,998
and I think that everybody understand

751
00:30:59,038 --> 00:31:05,478
that Ukraine more than ukrainians nobody

752
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:07,799
wants to stop this war but at the future

753
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:12,638
any negotiations it's understandable

754
00:31:07,798 --> 00:31:14,198
that two uh sides of the war not Russia

755
00:31:12,638 --> 00:31:15,718
and the United States because this is

756
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:18,320
not the war between Russia and the

757
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:20,678
United States This Is War of Russia

758
00:31:18,319 --> 00:31:23,759
against Ukraine and Ukrainian people so

759
00:31:20,679 --> 00:31:26,360
these two sides will be at the any

760
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:27,959
anyway will be at the negotiation a

761
00:31:26,359 --> 00:31:31,038
negotiation table then of course of

762
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:34,038
course United States like the strongest

763
00:31:31,038 --> 00:31:36,557
partner of the Ukraine and of course

764
00:31:34,038 --> 00:31:38,278
Europe I think Europe is very important

765
00:31:36,558 --> 00:31:40,558
I want to speak about it with the

766
00:31:38,278 --> 00:31:42,917
president yes Europe is very important

767
00:31:40,558 --> 00:31:46,239
for us because we really defend Europe

768
00:31:42,919 --> 00:31:49,319
for today all Europeans are really

769
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:51,360
recognized that we are defending line

770
00:31:49,319 --> 00:31:54,557
and they have real life and our people

771
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:57,719
are dying that's why they helped us and

772
00:31:54,558 --> 00:32:00,918
also it's about the NAT yes between like

773
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:05,479
the president said you have big nice

774
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:08,039
ocean yes between us but if we will not

775
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:10,199
stay Russia will go further to baltics

776
00:32:08,038 --> 00:32:12,839
and to Poland by the way but first to

777
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:15,518
the baltics it's understandable for them

778
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:18,319
because they've been they've been in the

779
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:20,360
USSR you know they they've been one of

780
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:23,319
the republics of the USSR and Putin

781
00:32:20,359 --> 00:32:25,637
wants to bring them back to his Empire

782
00:32:23,319 --> 00:32:28,878
it's a fact and when he will go there if

783
00:32:25,638 --> 00:32:31,719
we will not stay you will fight you're

784
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:34,798

you last speak with President Putin and

812
00:33:46,839 --> 00:33:50,037
what did he say that couple of days ago

813
00:33:48,679 --> 00:33:52,399
and what what did he tell you that gave

814
00:33:50,038 --> 00:33:53,958
you the assurance that he wanted peace

815
00:33:52,398 --> 00:33:57,959
well that's what I do my whole life is

816
00:33:53,960 --> 00:34:00,278
deals I know pretty good uh and I really

817
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:02,559
I've uh I've known him for a long time

818
00:34:00,278 --> 00:34:05,119
I've dealt with him for a long time he

819
00:34:02,558 --> 00:34:07,439
had to suffer through the uh Russia hoax

820
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:09,239
you know Russia Russia Russia was a hoax

821
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:11,319
it was all Biden it was nothing to do

822
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:14,319
with him so he had to suffer through

823
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:16,239
that and he he was able to do that uh I

824
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:19,560
think that uh he wants to make a deal

825
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:20,838
and he like to see it end it's all I do

826
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:23,398
that's what I do my whole life that's

827
00:34:20,838 --> 00:34:25,838
what I do is make deals and I'm in the

828
00:34:23,398 --> 00:34:29,077
middle of a mess because this is a real

829
00:34:25,838 --> 00:34:31,799
mess it's a very dangerous one if this

830
00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:33,559
doesn't get solved now it's not going to

831
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:34,800
get solved for a long time so I hope

00:34:33,559 --> 00:34:36,799
we're going to I hope we're going to get

833
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,639
it solved in the back please thank you

834
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,399
Mr President uh prime minister Storer

835
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:42,039
claimed repeatedly that his government

836
00:34:40,398 --> 00:34:44,157
believes in free speech and was not

837
00:34:42,039 --> 00:34:46,039
engaged in censorship uh but his

838
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:47,960
country's government arrest people for

839
00:34:46,039 --> 00:34:50,519
memes and thought crimes and even more

840
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:53,118
worrisome is pressuring uh American

841
00:34:50,519 --> 00:34:55,918
companies to to to censor Americans on

842
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:58,160
his behalf um how can he be a reliable

843
00:34:55,918 --> 00:35:00,158
trustworthy partner when he says are

844
00:34:58,159 --> 00:35:01,518
demonstrably false on such an important

845
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:03,998
topic well we actually spoke to them

846
00:35:01,519 --> 00:35:07,398
about that yesterday and we thought they

847
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:10,559
took it very very much too far JD was

848
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:12,520
very strong on it so was I and so was

849
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:13,998
Marco and we've been speaking to him

850
00:35:12,519 --> 00:35:16,039
about it Marco would you like to say

851
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,879
something about that we we have concerns

852
00:35:16,039 --> 00:35:19,999
obviously with the conduct of

853
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:21,400
particularly as it impacts Americans and

854
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,720
there's real concern that American

855
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:25,520
speech which is online could fall into

856
00:35:23,719 --> 00:35:27,759
the hands of British or any country's

857
00:35:25,519 --> 00:35:29,559
jurisdiction and so this is a point that

858
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,839
vice president made at Munich and and I

859
00:35:29,559 --> 00:35:32,837
think it's a very compelling one that

860
00:35:30,838 --> 00:35:34,519
what unites us with Europe as much as

861
00:35:32,838 --> 00:35:36,959
anything else is these shared values and

862
00:35:34,519 --> 00:35:38,959
one of them being free speech and so

863
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:41,838
Americans are threatened by it we're

864
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:44,400
going to need to take action in that

865
00:35:41,838 --> 00:35:46,278
regard it's AIG it's actually a very

866
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:48,040
important question we we spoke about

867
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:49,639
this in detail with the Prime Minister

868
00:35:48,039 --> 00:35:51,759
and the Ford secretary and others at at

869
00:35:49,639 --> 00:35:53,999
lunch yesterday and I know that

870
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:56,359
Secretary of Commerce lutnick followed

871
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,719
up in private meetings last night this

872
00:35:56,358 --> 00:36:00,518
is really important We Believe Americans

873
00:35:58,719 --> 00:36:02,158
have the right to speak their mind even

874
00:36:00,519 --> 00:36:03,878
if we in this room disagree with them

875
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:05,679
they have the right to speak their mind

876
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:07,319
in the Public Square which is often

877
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:09,199
online these days and we're going to

878
00:36:07,318 --> 00:36:11,238
defend that right as it pertains to

879
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:13,598
American companies and American citizens

880
00:36:11,239 --> 00:36:14,838
vigorously if we have to I do think that

881
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:16,760
under the president's leadership we're

882
00:36:14,838 --> 00:36:18,919
going to find common ground with our

883
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:21,078
friends in the UK on this question but

884
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:23,359
it remains to be seen the principle that

885
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:24,999
will guide us is we believe in free

886
00:36:23,358 --> 00:36:27,238
speech in this country and we'll fight

887
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,040
for it for American citizens Mr Mr

888
00:36:27,239 --> 00:36:30,799
President the deal is there any other

889
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:33,718
oil and gas component to the deal is it

890
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:35,118
all critical a little bit we'll see on L

891
00:36:33,719 --> 00:36:36,679
but we're not really looking for that so

892
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:39,519
much we got a lot we have more than

893
00:36:36,679 --> 00:36:40,837
anybody in the world by far so no we're

894
00:36:39,519 --> 00:36:43,358
not talking about it too much but a

895
00:36:40,838 --> 00:36:46,559
little bit I think it it it affects also

896
00:36:43,358 --> 00:36:48,959
but for the most part no and Sir is

897
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:52,597
there any uh agreement from uh Ukraine

898
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:54,920
to purchase uh us LG as part of the deal

899
00:36:52,599 --> 00:36:56,640
or is that on the table at all no Mr

900
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:58,040
pres we don't need Mr President I just

901
00:36:56,639 --> 00:36:59,478
wanted to ask you about

902
00:36:58,039 --> 00:37:01,078
you just mentioned that you'd spoken to

903
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:03,720
Vladimir Putin a couple of days ago just

904
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:05,559
to be clear that's a new call not the

905
00:37:03,719 --> 00:37:07,799
one that you I've spoken to him on

906
00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:10,198
numerous occasions okay and how was the

907

927
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:51,519
agreement what if Russia tries to invade

928
00:37:49,519 --> 00:37:52,639
or or there's Russian agression spot I

929
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:54,118
just told you I don't think that's going

00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:55,558
to happen and if that were going to

931
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:56,639
happen I wouldn't make a deal if I

932
00:37:55,559 --> 00:37:58,958
thought that was going to happen I

933
00:37:56,639 --> 00:38:01,358
wouldn't make a deal some people you

934
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:04,799
know they ought to focus on CNN on

935
00:38:01,358 --> 00:38:07,279
Survival not asking me these ridiculous

936
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:09,280
questions focus on Surviving because

937
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:12,680
CNN's got such low ratings I don't think

938
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:14,919
they're going to survive uh let's go

939
00:38:12,679 --> 00:38:18,597
yeah please go ahead more since already

940
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:21,280
I already mentioned Poland uh Poland was

941
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:24,039
under Russian control for decades after

942
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:26,680
the second world war when I was a kid I

943
00:38:24,039 --> 00:38:30,317
looked at the United States not only as

944
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:32,438
a most powerful country richest country

945
00:38:30,318 --> 00:38:36,077
in the world the country that has great

946
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:40,279
music great movies great muscle cars but

947
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:41,1000
also as a Force for good do you and now

948
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:44,358
I'm talking with my friends in Poland

949
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,118
and they they are worried that you align

950
00:38:44,358 --> 00:38:49,479
yourself too much with

951
00:38:46,119 --> 00:38:52,599
Putin what's your message for

952
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:55,720
them well if I didn't align myself with

953
00:38:52,599 --> 00:38:58,759
both of them you'd never have a deal you

954
00:38:55,719 --> 00:39:01,238
want me to say uh really terrible things

955
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:02,720
about Putin and then say hi Vladimir how

956
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:05,239
are we doing on the deal that doesn't

957
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:07,118
work that way I'm not aligned with Putin

958
00:39:05,239 --> 00:39:09,038
I'm not aligned with anybody I'm aligned

959
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:11,838
with the United States of America and

960
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:13,798
for the good of the world I'm aligned

961
00:39:11,838 --> 00:39:15,479
with the world and I want to get this

962
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:17,679
thing over with you see the hatred he's

963
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:18,960
got for Putin it's very tough for me to

964
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:21,239
make a deal with that kind of hat he's

965
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:23,359
got tremendous hatred and I understand

966
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:26,679
that but I can tell you the other side

967
00:39:23,358 --> 00:39:27,959
isn't exactly in love with you know him

968
00:39:26,679 --> 00:39:30,357
either

969
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:32,1000
uh so it's not a question of alignment I

970
00:39:30,358 --> 00:39:34,598
have to I'm aligned with the world I

971
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,560
want to get the things set i'm aligned

972
00:39:34,599 --> 00:39:38,039
with

973
00:39:35,559 --> 00:39:40,719
Europe I want to see if we can get this

974
00:39:38,039 --> 00:39:42,317
thing done you want me to be tough I

975
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:45,199
could be tougher than any human being

976
00:39:42,318 --> 00:39:46,558
you've ever seen I'd be so tough but

977
00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:48,518
you're never going to get a deal that

978
00:39:46,559 --> 00:39:51,158
way so that's the way it goes all right

979
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:53,198
one more question yeah please I would

980
00:39:51,159 --> 00:39:55,038
respond to this so look for four years

981
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:56,478
in the United States of America we had a

982
00:39:55,039 --> 00:39:58,239
president who stood up at press

983
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:00,880
conferences and talked tough about

984
00:39:58,239 --> 00:40:02,838
Vladimir Putin and then Putin invaded

985
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:05,679
Ukraine and destroyed a significant

986
00:40:02,838 --> 00:40:08,158
chunk of the country the path to peace

987
00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:11,518
and the path to Prosperity is maybe

988
00:40:08,159 --> 00:40:13,798
engaging in diplomacy we tried the

989
00:40:11,519 --> 00:40:16,078
pathway of Joe Biden of thumping our

990
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:18,439
chest and pretending that the president

991
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:19,760
of the United States's words mattered

992
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:22,359
more than the president of the United

993
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:24,359
States's actions what makes America a

994
00:40:22,358 --> 00:40:26,358
good country is America engaging in

995
00:40:24,358 --> 00:40:31,318
diplomacy that's what president Trump is

996
00:40:26,358 --> 00:40:36,078
doing can I ask you sure yeah yeah okay

997
00:40:31,318 --> 00:40:40,597
so he occupied it uh our parts big parts

998
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:42,760
of Ukraine part of East and Crimea uh so

999
00:40:40,599 --> 00:40:44,599
he occupied it on

1000
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:47,599
2014

1001
00:40:44,599 --> 00:40:50,200
so during a lot of years so I'm not

1002
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:53,118

1003
00:40:50,199 --> 00:40:55,357

1005
00:40:55,358 --> 00:40:59,878
the president Trump and God bless that's

1006
00:40:57,719 --> 00:41:02,837
now president Trump will stop him but

1007
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:05,399

president $350 billion we gave you

1110
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,960
military equipment and you men are brave

1111
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:09,558
but they had to use our

1112
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:11,838
military if you didn't have our military

1113
00:45:09,559 --> 00:45:13,879
equipment inv if you didn't have our

1114
00:45:11,838 --> 00:45:16,557
military equipment this war would have

1115
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:18,960
been over in two weeks in three days I

1116
00:45:16,559 --> 00:45:21,440
heard it from Putin in three days this

1117
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:22,799
is something in two weeks of course he

1118
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:25,400
has it's going to be a very hard thing

1119
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:28,280
to do business like this I tell you just

1120
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:30,640
say thank you I said a lot

1121
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:32,879
of am except that there are

1122
00:45:30,639 --> 00:45:34,598
disagreements and let's go litigate

1123
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:36,558
those disagreements rather than trying

1124
00:45:34,599 --> 00:45:38,440
to fight it out in the American Media

1125
00:45:36,559 --> 00:45:40,119
when you're wrong we know that you're

1126
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:41,759
wrong but you see I think it's good for

1127
00:45:40,119 --> 00:45:43,519
the American people to see what's going

1128
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:45,400
on over here I think it's very important

1129
00:45:43,519 --> 00:45:48,278
that's why I kept this going so

1130
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:51,039
long you have to be thankful you don't

1131
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:53,720
have the Cs you're buried there you're

1132
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:56,479

1133
00:45:53,719 --> 00:45:58,759
on soldiers listen you're running low on

1134
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:00,640
solders it would be a damn good thing

1135
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:02,558

1136
00:46:00,639 --> 00:46:05,398
want to cease fire I don't want to ceas

1137
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:07,959

1138
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:09,558

00:47:08,199 --> 00:47:13,357

00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:32,359
respect him they didn't respect Obama

1174
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,680
they respect

1175
00:47:32,358 --> 00:47:36,117
me let me tell you Putin went through a

1176
00:47:34,679 --> 00:47:39,039
hell of a lot with me he went through a

1177
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:41,559
phony Witch Hunt where they used him and

1178
00:47:39,039 --> 00:47:43,598
Russia Russia Russia Russia you ever

1180
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:49,999
was a phony Hunter Biden Joe Biden scam

1181
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:53,200
Hillary Clinton Shifty Adam Schiff it

1182
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:55,318
was a Democrat scam and he had to go

1183
00:47:53,199 --> 00:47:57,758
through that and he did go through it we

1184
00:47:55,318 --> 00:47:59,238
didn't end up in a war and he went

1185
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:00,960
through it he was accused of all that

1186
00:47:59,239 --> 00:48:04,317
stuff he had nothing to do with it it

1187
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:07,359
came out of Hunter Biden's bathroom it

1188
00:48:04,318 --> 00:48:11,279
came out of Hunter Biden's bedroom it

1189
00:48:07,358 --> 00:48:14,919
was disgusting and then they said oh oh

1190
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:18,280
the laptop from hell was made by Russia

1191
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:19,719
the 51 agents the whole thing was a scam

1192
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:22,680
and he had to put up with that he was

1193
00:48:19,719 --> 00:48:25,039
being accused of all that stuff all I

1194
00:48:22,679 --> 00:48:27,959
can say is this he might have broken

1195
00:48:25,039 --> 00:48:30,439
deals with Obama and Bush and he might

1196
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:31,680
have broken him with Biden he did maybe

1197
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:34,040
maybe he didn't I don't know what

1198
00:48:31,679 --> 00:48:35,639
happened but he didn't break him with me

1199
00:48:34,039 --> 00:48:38,999
he wants to make a deal I don't know if

1200
00:48:35,639 --> 00:48:42,398
you can make a deal the problem is I've

1201
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:43,919
empowered you to be a tough guy and I

1202
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:45,719
don't think you'd be a tough guy without

1203
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:47,759
the United States and your people are

1204
00:48:45,719 --> 00:48:50,078
very brave but you're either going to

1205
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:53,040
make a deal or we're out and if we're

1206
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:55,040
out you'll fight it out I don't think

1207
00:48:53,039 --> 00:48:58,117
it's going to be pretty but you'll fight

1208
00:48:55,039 --> 00:49:00,399
it out but you don't have the cards but

1209
00:48:58,119 --> 00:49:02,720
once we sign that deal you're in a much

1210
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:05,079
better position but you're not acting at

1211
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:07,518

00:49:07,519 --> 00:49:12,398
